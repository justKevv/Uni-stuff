      <p>
        In 2010, based on the needs of the community and the industry related to
        the Diploma IV (D-IV) program in the field of informatics, Polinema
        established a new study program, Diploma IV (D-IV) in Informatics
        Engineering (IE). At the beginning of its establishment, the number of
        students in the D-IV IE program consisted of only 46 students, but by
        2015, the number of students in the D-IV IE program had increased to 545
        students.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rapid growth in the number of students in all D-III IE and D-IV IE
        study programs prompted the leadership at Polinema to merge these two
        study programs under one roof under the Department of Electrical
        Engineering. Based on this, in 2015, under Director's Decree Number 53,
        in order to improve the quality of management and optimize resources,
        the Department of Information Technology (JTI) was established with
        programs in D-III IE and D-IV IE.
